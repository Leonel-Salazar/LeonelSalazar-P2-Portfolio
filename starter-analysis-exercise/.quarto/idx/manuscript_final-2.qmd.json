The research will be accomplished using data sets derived from the agencies National Agricultural Statistics Service, Agricultural Statistics Board, and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Data sets containing several years of hive losses based on varroa and bacterium losses including recent possible environmental thermal global warming. A visualization of outcomes using R demonstrating and validating possible detrimental effects on honeybee colonies in the United States and Texas wrought by the negative impact of mites, bacterium, and global warming that will affect honey production and inevitably impact food production.\n\n{{< pagebreak >}}\n\n# Introduction\n\n\n### Composition of Honey\n\nThe first image is a pie chart that illustrates the composition of honey\nby percentage. The main components are:\n\n-   **Fructose**: 38.5%\n-   **Glucose**: 31%\n-   **Water**: 17.1%\n-   **Maltose**: 7.2%\n-   **Other components**:\n    -   Sucrose: 1.5%\n    -   Minerals, Vitamins, Enzymes: 0.5%\n    -   Trisaccharides, Carbohydrates: 4.2%\n\nThis composition indicates that honey is primarily made up of sugars,\nspecifically fructose and glucose, with water being the third major\ncomponent. The presence of minerals, vitamins, and enzymes, though in\nsmaller amounts, adds nutritional value to honey. This detailed\nbreakdown underscores honey's role as a natural sweetener with\nadditional health benefits beyond its primary carbohydrate content.\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n# Create a data frame with the composition of honey\nhoney_data <- data.frame(\n  component = c(\"Fructose\", \"Glucose\", \"Water\", \"Maltose\", \"Trisaccharides, Carbohydrates\", \"Sucrose\", \"Minerals, Vitamins, Enzymes\"),\n  percentage = c(38.5, 31.0, 17.1, 7.2, 4.2, 1.5, 0.5)\n)\n\n# Define colors for the segments\nhoney_data$color <- c(\"#FFA726\", \"#FB8C00\", \"#FFD54F\", \"#FFB74D\", \"#90CAF9\", \"#F06292\", \"#BA68C8\")\n\n# Plot with ggplot2\nggplot(honey_data, aes(x = \"\", y = percentage, fill = component)) +\n  geom_bar(width = 0.8, stat = \"identity\", color = \"white\") +\n  coord_polar(\"y\", start = 0) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = honey_data$color) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=1.8, label = paste0(percentage, \"%\")), position = position_stack(vjust = 0.6), size = 3, color = \"black\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"COMPOSITION OF HONEY\",\n    subtitle = \"Illustration of honey components by percentage\",\n    fill = NULL\n  ) +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 22, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5, family = \"lobster\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0.5),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 12)\n  )\n```\n\nHoneybees have been nature's pollinators for centuries, with documented relationships with humans dating back to ancient Egyptians and Hindus. Historically, humans have maintained beehives, using honey as medicine in cultures such as the Egyptians, Assyrians, Chinese, Greeks, and Romans. The natural antibacterial properties of honey made it a valuable treatment for wounds, preventing infection, a practice used by Romans and Russians during World War I. Honeybees and other pollinators are critical for food production and nutritional security, yet bees face a variety of survival challenges. Currently, Varroa mites impact bee colonies and this mite infestation, a tiny red-brown parasite that can live on adult honeybees and reproduce on larvae and pupae in the developing brood. Another major threat is American Foulbrood Disease (AFB), caused by the bacterium Paenibacillus larvae. A disease that is fatal to honeybee larvae and found worldwide. The only effective control measure is to incinerate and destroy infected hives and live bees mitigating the infectious spread to other colonies. In addition, the exploration of climate change impacting honeybee colony losses has only recently been researched. While there are correlations between higher winter temperatures and greater colony losses, the effects of warmer autumn and winter temperatures on colony population dynamics and age structure as potential causes of reduced colony survival have not yet been fully investigated.Index Catalog // USDA Economics, Statistics and Market Information System.

The map uses different colors to\nrepresent the year of the first appearance of Varroa mites in each\nstate:\n\n-   **1986 - 1987**: Red\n-   **1988 - 1989**: Yellow\n-   **1990 - 1991**: Green\n-   **1992 - 1993**: Blue\n-   **1994 - 1995**: Grey\n-   **NA**: States where data is not available\n\nThe map reveals the progressive spread of Varroa mites from the\nmid-1980s to the mid-1990s, affecting bee colonies across the country.\nThe earliest appearances were concentrated in specific regions and\ngradually spread to more states over time. This visual representation\nhighlights the increasing geographical distribution of Varroa mites and\nunderscores the growing challenge they pose to beekeeping and\nagricultural industries in the United States.\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(maps)\n```\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nstates <- st_as_sf(map(\"state\", plot = FALSE, fill = TRUE))\n```\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nvarroa_data <- data.frame(\n  state = c(\"alabama\", \"alaska\", \"arizona\", \"arkansas\", \"california\", \"colorado\", \n            \"connecticut\", \"delaware\", \"florida\", \"georgia\", \"hawaii\", \"idaho\", \n            \"illinois\", \"indiana\", \"iowa\", \"kansas\", \"kentucky\", \"louisiana\", \n            \"maine\", \"maryland\", \"massachusetts\", \"michigan\", \"minnesota\", \n            \"mississippi\", \"missouri\", \"montana\", \"nebraska\", \"nevada\", \"new hampshire\", \n            \"new jersey\", \"new mexico\", \"new york\", \"north carolina\", \"north dakota\", \n            \"ohio\", \"oklahoma\", \"oregon\", \"pennsylvania\", \"rhode island\", \n            \"south carolina\", \"south dakota\", \"tennessee\", \"texas\", \"utah\", \n            \"vermont\", \"virginia\", \"washington\", \"west virginia\", \"wisconsin\", \"wyoming\"),\n  year = c(\"1986 - 1987\", \"1988 - 1989\", \"1990 - 1991\", \"1992 - 1993\", \"1994 - 1995\",\n           \"1986 - 1987\", \"1988 - 1989\", \"1990 - 1991\", \"1992 - 1993\", \"1994 - 1995\",\n           \"1986 - 1987\", \"1988 - 1989\", \"1990 - 1991\", \"1992 - 1993\", \"1994 - 1995\",\n           \"1986 - 1987\", \"1988 - 1989\", \"1990 - 1991\", \"1992 - 1993\", \"1994 - 1995\",\n           \"1986 - 1987\", \"1988 - 1989\", \"1990 - 1991\", \"1992 - 1993\", \"1994 - 1995\",\n           \"1986 - 1987\", \"1988 - 1989\", \"1990 - 1991\", \"1992 - 1993\", \"1994 - 1995\",\n           \"1986 - 1987\", \"1988 - 1989\", \"1990 - 1991\", \"1992 - 1993\", \"1994 - 1995\",\n           \"1986 - 1987\", \"1988 - 1989\", \"1990 - 1991\", \"1992 - 1993\", \"1994 - 1995\",\n           \"1986 - 1987\", \"1988 - 1989\", \"1990 - 1991\", \"1992 - 1993\", \"1994 - 1995\",\n           \"1986 - 1987\", \"1988 - 1989\", \"1990 - 1991\", \"1992 - 1993\", \"1994 - 1995\")\n)\n```\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nstates <- merge(states, varroa_data, by.x = \"ID\", by.y = \"state\", all.x = TRUE)\n```\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nggplot(data = states) +\n  geom_sf(aes(fill = year), color = \"#292929\", size = 0.2) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\n      \"1986 - 1987\" = \"#CD2626\", \n      \"1988 - 1989\" = \"#CD9B1D\", \n      \"1990 - 1991\" = \"#FFD700\", \n      \"1992 - 1993\" = \"#00CD00\", \n      \"1994 - 1995\" = \"#104E8B\"\n    ),\n    na.value = \"#757575\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Spread of Varroa Mites\",\n    fill = \"Year of First Appearance\"\n  )\n\n```\n\nWritten By:sdns6mchl4.

Given the importance of bee colonies in agriculture, it was logical to source data from the following two authoritative websites: 1. USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS): This site provides comprehensive agricultural data, including statistics on honey production and colony health. 2. Bee Informed Partnership: This site offers detailed insights and research on bee colony management and health, contributing valuable information on the status and trends of bee populations.

We had to remove blank spaces and columns that were not pertinent to our analysis. We then filtered out other observations that did not directly deal with the data we are exploring. We are looking for cause of death to bee colonies and how they are affected by mites and climate change so we wanted to single out data that represented the losses so we can explore the different states by year and determine how the colonies were affected.\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(knitr)\n```\n\n```{r}\n\nlibrary(here)\n\nhere()\n\n# Read the

The research will be accomplished using data sets derived from the agencies National Agricultural Statistics Service, Agricultural Statistics Board, and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Data sets containing several years of hive losses based on varroa and bacterium losses including recent possible environmental thermal global warming. A visualization of outcomes using R demonstrating and validating possible detrimental effects on honeybee colonies in the United States and Texas wrought by the negative impact of mites, bacterium, and global warming that will affect honey production and inevitably impact food production.\n\n{{< pagebreak >}}\n\n# Introduction\n\n\n### Composition of Honey\n\nThe first image is a pie chart that illustrates the composition of honey\nby percentage. The main components are:\n\n-   **Fructose**: 38.5%\n-   **Glucose**: 31%\n-   **Water**: 17.1%\n-   **Maltose**: 7.2%\n-   **Other components**:\n    -   Sucrose: 1.5%\n    -   Minerals, Vitamins, Enzymes: 0.5%\n    -   Trisaccharides, Carbohydrates: 4.2%\n\nThis composition indicates that honey is primarily made up of sugars,\nspecifically fructose and glucose, with water being the third major\ncomponent. The presence of minerals, vitamins, and enzymes, though in\nsmaller amounts, adds nutritional value to honey. This detailed\nbreakdown underscores honey's role as a natural sweetener with\nadditional health benefits beyond its primary carbohydrate content.\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n# Create a data frame with the composition of honey\nhoney_data <- data.frame(\n  component = c(\"Fructose\", \"Glucose\", \"Water\", \"Maltose\", \"Trisaccharides, Carbohydrates\", \"Sucrose\", \"Minerals, Vitamins, Enzymes\"),\n  percentage = c(38.5, 31.0, 17.1, 7.2, 4.2, 1.5, 0.5)\n)\n\n# Define colors for the segments\nhoney_data$color <- c(\"#FFA726\", \"#FB8C00\", \"#FFD54F\", \"#FFB74D\", \"#90CAF9\", \"#F06292\", \"#BA68C8\")\n\n# Plot with ggplot2\nggplot(honey_data, aes(x = \"\", y = percentage, fill = component)) +\n  geom_bar(width = 0.8, stat = \"identity\", color = \"white\") +\n  coord_polar(\"y\", start = 0) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = honey_data$color) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=1.8, label = paste0(percentage, \"%\")), position = position_stack(vjust = 0.6), size = 3, color = \"black\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"COMPOSITION OF HONEY\",\n    subtitle = \"Illustration of honey components by percentage\",\n    fill = NULL\n  ) +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 22, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5, family = \"lobster\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0.5),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 12)\n  )\n```\n\nHoneybees have been nature's pollinators for centuries, with documented relationships with humans dating back to ancient Egyptians and Hindus. Historically, humans have maintained beehives, using honey as medicine in cultures such as the Egyptians, Assyrians, Chinese, Greeks, and Romans. The natural antibacterial properties of honey made it a valuable treatment for wounds, preventing infection, a practice used by Romans and Russians during World War I. Honeybees and other pollinators are critical for food production and nutritional security, yet bees face a variety of survival challenges. Currently, Varroa mites impact bee colonies and this mite infestation, a tiny red-brown parasite that can live on adult honeybees and reproduce on larvae and pupae in the developing brood. Another major threat is American Foulbrood Disease (AFB), caused by the bacterium Paenibacillus larvae. A disease that is fatal to honeybee larvae and found worldwide. The only effective control measure is to incinerate and destroy infected hives and live bees mitigating the infectious spread to other colonies. In addition, the exploration of climate change impacting honeybee colony losses has only recently been researched. While there are correlations between higher winter temperatures and greater colony losses, the effects of warmer autumn and winter temperatures on colony population dynamics and age structure as potential causes of reduced colony survival have not yet been fully investigated.Index Catalog // USDA Economics, Statistics and Market Information System.

The map uses different colors to\nrepresent the year of the first appearance of Varroa mites in each\nstate:\n\n-   **1986 - 1987**: Red\n-   **1988 - 1989**: Yellow\n-   **1990 - 1991**: Green\n-   **1992 - 1993**: Blue\n-   **1994 - 1995**: Grey\n-   **NA**: States where data is not available\n\nThe map reveals the progressive spread of Varroa mites from the\nmid-1980s to the mid-1990s, affecting bee colonies across the country.\nThe earliest appearances were concentrated in specific regions and\ngradually spread to more states over time. This visual representation\nhighlights the increasing geographical distribution of Varroa mites and\nunderscores the growing challenge they pose to beekeeping and\nagricultural industries in the United States.\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(maps)\n```\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nstates <- st_as_sf(map(\"state\", plot = FALSE, fill = TRUE))\n```\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nvarroa_data <- data.frame(\n  state = c(\"alabama\", \"alaska\", \"arizona\", \"arkansas\", \"california\", \"colorado\", \n            \"connecticut\", \"delaware\", \"florida\", \"georgia\", \"hawaii\", \"idaho\", \n            \"illinois\", \"indiana\", \"iowa\", \"kansas\", \"kentucky\", \"louisiana\", \n            \"maine\", \"maryland\", \"massachusetts\", \"michigan\", \"minnesota\", \n            \"mississippi\", \"missouri\", \"montana\", \"nebraska\", \"nevada\", \"new hampshire\", \n            \"new jersey\", \"new mexico\", \"new york\", \"north carolina\", \"north dakota\", \n            \"ohio\", \"oklahoma\", \"oregon\", \"pennsylvania\", \"rhode island\", \n            \"south carolina\", \"south dakota\", \"tennessee\", \"texas\", \"utah\", \n            \"vermont\", \"virginia\", \"washington\", \"west virginia\", \"wisconsin\", \"wyoming\"),\n  year = c(\"1986 - 1987\", \"1988 - 1989\", \"1990 - 1991\", \"1992 - 1993\", \"1994 - 1995\",\n           \"1986 - 1987\", \"1988 - 1989\", \"1990 - 1991\", \"1992 - 1993\", \"1994 - 1995\",\n           \"1986 - 1987\", \"1988 - 1989\", \"1990 - 1991\", \"1992 - 1993\", \"1994 - 1995\",\n           \"1986 - 1987\", \"1988 - 1989\", \"1990 - 1991\", \"1992 - 1993\", \"1994 - 1995\",\n           \"1986 - 1987\", \"1988 - 1989\", \"1990 - 1991\", \"1992 - 1993\", \"1994 - 1995\",\n           \"1986 - 1987\", \"1988 - 1989\", \"1990 - 1991\", \"1992 - 1993\", \"1994 - 1995\",\n           \"1986 - 1987\", \"1988 - 1989\", \"1990 - 1991\", \"1992 - 1993\", \"1994 - 1995\",\n           \"1986 - 1987\", \"1988 - 1989\", \"1990 - 1991\", \"1992 - 1993\", \"1994 - 1995\",\n           \"1986 - 1987\", \"1988 - 1989\", \"1990 - 1991\", \"1992 - 1993\", \"1994 - 1995\",\n           \"1986 - 1987\", \"1988 - 1989\", \"1990 - 1991\", \"1992 - 1993\", \"1994 - 1995\")\n)\n```\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nstates <- merge(states, varroa_data, by.x = \"ID\", by.y = \"state\", all.x = TRUE)\n```\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\nggplot(data = states) +\n  geom_sf(aes(fill = year), color = \"#292929\", size = 0.2) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\n      \"1986 - 1987\" = \"#CD2626\", \n      \"1988 - 1989\" = \"#CD9B1D\", \n      \"1990 - 1991\" = \"#FFD700\", \n      \"1992 - 1993\" = \"#00CD00\", \n      \"1994 - 1995\" = \"#104E8B\"\n    ),\n    na.value = \"#757575\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Spread of Varroa Mites\",\n    fill = \"Year of First Appearance\"\n  )\n\n```\n\nWritten By:sdns6mchl4.

Given the importance of bee colonies in agriculture, it was logical to source data from the following two authoritative websites: 1. USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS): This site provides comprehensive agricultural data, including statistics on honey production and colony health. 2. Bee Informed Partnership: This site offers detailed insights and research on bee colony management and health, contributing valuable information on the status and trends of bee populations.

We had to remove blank spaces and columns that were not pertinent to our analysis. We then filtered out other observations that did not directly deal with the data we are exploring. We are looking for cause of death to bee colonies and how they are affected by mites and climate change so we wanted to single out data that represented the losses so we can explore the different states by year and determine how the colonies were affected.\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(knitr)\n```\n\n```{r}\n\nlibrary(here)\n\nhere()\n\n# Read the
